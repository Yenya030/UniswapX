# Tested Attack Vectors
This document tracks manual fuzzing and unit tests exploring potential vulnerabilities in the repository.

## Mismatched Nonlinear Dutch Decay arrays

- **Description**: Craft a `NonlinearDutchDecay` struct where `relativeBlocks` encodes more block points than provided in `relativeAmounts`.
- **Expectation**: The order decoding should revert with `InvalidDecayCurve` instead of silently misbehaving.
- **Result**: Before patch the library allowed this mismatch and the provided test `NonlinearDutchDecayLibBugTest` failed. After introducing a length check the test passes confirming the bug is fixed.


## Reentrancy via Callback

*Vector*: A malicious fill contract reenters the same reactor during its `reactorCallback` hook to execute a second order.

*Test*: `testReentrancySameReactor` (added in `LimitOrderReactor.t.sol`) deploys `MockFillContractReentrant` and attempts to perform such reentrancy.

*Result*: The transaction reverts with `"ReentrancyGuard: reentrant call"`, demonstrating the builtâ€‘in guard prevents this attack.
